Development notes:

When building, make certain the SAT4j .jar is above the Alloy4 .jar in
priority. Alloy4's .jar file contains an outdated version of
SAT4j. One of the fixes made in recent versions is that calling
addClause with unit clauses returns an appropriate IConstr, rather
than null. According to the changelog, now addClause will return null
only when the clause can be ignored.

May 29 2014 (TN): Removed SAT4J's folder from the project's alloy4.jar
entirely. It was working fine in Eclipse with the above ordering, but the
exported JAR was using the wrong version of SAT4J still.
